I'm a passionate STEM educator with 7 years of experience in fostering young minds and sparking their interest in science and technology. My journey in the realm of education has been incredibly rewarding, but my heart has always been captivated by the transformative power of computer science and analytics.

My fascination with data and its potential to drive strategic decision-making led me to pursue a Business Intelligence Analyst certification. This certification has equipped me with the skills to extract valuable insights from data and translate them into actionable business strategies.

Currently, I'm thrilled to be learning and developing my skills at Tripleten. The opportunity to work in a dynamic environment that encourages continuous learning and innovation is incredibly exciting to me. I'm eager to apply my analytical skills and passion for problem-solving in the role of an analyst.

I believe in the power of lifelong learning and am always looking to expand my knowledge and skills. I'm excited to embark on this new journey in the tech industry and look forward to the challenges and opportunities it brings!
